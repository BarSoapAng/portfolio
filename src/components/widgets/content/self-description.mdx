I'm Angela and I'm a mechatronics engineering student from the University of Waterloo.
I fell in love with robotics when I first joined my high schoool's robotics club and went on to become my team's co-captain. During my first co-op at Ericsson, I was reminded of how much I enjoyed software. I love creating and being creative, which is also why I loved designing this website.
<br/>
Although I plan to pursue a career in software, I never want to close myself off to potential hardware jobs either. After all, I also love tinkering with physical pieces.
<br/>
When I'm "living life", I can be found creating content for my social media page or playing video games.
